# Travel-time-changes-due-to-weak-velocity-anomalies

This set of codes support the results of the book chapter "Locating Velocity Changes in Elastic Media with Coda Wave Interferometry" by R. Snieder, A. Duran, A. Obermann.

 The main goal is to study travel time changes observed in multiple-scattering elastic waves (i.e., coda waves). They can be discribed statistically by a probabilistic sensitivity function (i.e., sensitivity kernel).
